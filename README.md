# Work Samples

This repository includes selected work samples that demonstrate how I approach systems documentation, QA, and AI-assisted content review.

All examples come from a real project, Relocation Roadmaps (https://relocationroadmaps.com). They are shared to illustrate process, structure, and decision-making, not as polished deliverables.

## What you’ll find

- QA artifacts: test plans, test cases, and sample bug reports
- AI QA examples: an evaluation scorecard and a reviewed guide section
- Prompt samples: excerpts from prompts used to produce structured and accurate AI output
- Systems notes: brief documentation of live automations

Some prompts and materials appear in abbreviated or redacted form.
