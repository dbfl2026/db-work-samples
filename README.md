# Data Integrity & Operations Support - Work Samples

This repo contains practical work samples focused on data hygiene, standards, validation, and operations documentation - built to reduce errors, improve consistency, and keep workflows reliable.

## Start Here
- Data Integrity: 
- Ops Documentation: 

## What I do well in this area
- Data cleanup and standardization (duplicates, formatting, required fields, consistency rules)
- Process documentation and SOPs that prevent errors and make work repeatable
- Troubleshooting and root-cause notes that help teams fix issues permanently

This repository includes selected work samples that demonstrate how I approach systems documentation, QA, and AI-assisted content review.

All examples come from a real project, Relocation Roadmaps (https://relocationroadmaps.com). They are shared to illustrate process, structure, and decision-making, not as polished deliverables.

## What you’ll find

- QA artifacts: test plans, test cases, and sample bug reports
- AI QA examples: an evaluation scorecard and a reviewed guide section
- Prompt samples: excerpts from prompts used to produce structured and accurate AI output
- Systems notes: brief documentation of live automations

Some prompts and materials appear in abbreviated or redacted form.
