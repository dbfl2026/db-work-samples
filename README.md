# AI Operations and Workflow Infrastructure - Work Samples

This repo contains practical work samples from a startup project, focused on AI operations, workflow QA, data integrity, and lightweight automation support - built to keep outputs consistent and workflows traceable.

Best single example: the AI Guide Audit Workflow shows the full chain from audit output to tracking and review across Google Sheets, Zapier, and Notion.

## What I do well in this area
- Data cleanup and standardization (duplicates, formatting, required fields, consistency rules)
- Process documentation and SOPs that prevent errors and make work repeatable
- Troubleshooting and root-cause notes that help teams fix issues permanently

This repository includes selected work samples that demonstrate how I approach systems documentation, workflow QA, and an AI-assisted audit workflow.

All examples come from a real project, Relocation Roadmaps (https://relocationroadmaps.com). They are shared to illustrate process, structure, and decision-making, not as polished deliverables.

## What you’ll find
- QA artifacts: test plans, test cases, and sample bug reports
- AI workflow examples: an evaluation scorecard and a reviewed guide section
- Prompt system excerpts: redacted prompt templates used to produce structured output
- Systems notes: brief documentation of live automations
