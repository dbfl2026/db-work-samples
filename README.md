# AI Operations and Workflow Infrastructure - Work Samples

This repo contains practical work samples from a startup project, focused on AI operations, workflow QA, data integrity, and lightweight automation support - built to keep outputs consistent and workflows traceable.

## Start Here

## What I do well in this area
- Keep AI-assisted workflows consistent when inputs are messy
- Build prompt templates, scorecards, and SOPs that reduce drift and rework
- Maintain clean, usable data (standardization, required fields, deduping, naming conventions)
- Troubleshoot issues and write root-cause notes so problems don’t repeat

These samples come from a real project, Relocation Roadmaps (https://relocationroadmaps.com). They are shared to show process, structure, and decision-making, not as polished client deliverables.

## What you’ll find
- AI audit workflow artifacts: structured outputs (TSV and JSON) and review tracking across Sheets, Zapier, and Notion
- QA artifacts: test plans, test cases, and sample bug reports
- AI workflow examples: evaluation scorecards and reviewed guide sections
- Prompt system excerpts: redacted prompt templates used to produce structured output
- Systems notes: brief documentation of live automations
