# AI Operations and Workflow Infrastructure - Work Samples

This repo contains production work samples covering AI operations, workflow QA, data integrity, and system design - built to keep outputs consistent and workflows traceable.

## What I do well in this area
- Keep AI-assisted workflows consistent when inputs are messy
- Build prompt templates, scorecards, and SOPs that reduce drift and rework
- Maintain clean, usable data (standardization, required fields, deduping, naming conventions)
- Design operational systems with built-in QA and scope discipline
- Troubleshoot issues and write root-cause notes so problems don't repeat

The Relocation Roadmaps samples come from a real project (https://relocationroadmaps.com) and are shared to show process, structure, and decision-making, not as polished client deliverables. The Chargeback Defender samples are from a live product built and shipped in 9 days (https://guideworks.co/chargeback-defender).
